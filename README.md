<!-- Project Description -->
## Project Description

The **Netflix Clone** is a comprehensive **streaming application** that mimics the core functionalities and design of Netflix. This project provides users with access to a vast library of **movies** and **TV shows**, along with features such as **user registration**, **commenting**, and **personalized watchlists**. The application is powered by a **dynamic API integration**, offering real-time updates for the latest films and series. Without a registered account, users cannot access the content, ensuring a gated and personalized experience.
